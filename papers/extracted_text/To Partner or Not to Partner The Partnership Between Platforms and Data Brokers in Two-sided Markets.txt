To Partner or Not to Partner? The Partnership Between Platforms and 
Data Brokers in Two-sided Markets 
Abstract 
Data has become an important competitive asset , especially for online advertising platforms , and t he 
huge demand for data has spawned a new data broker industry. Platforms usually partner with data 
brokers to acquire external data to enhance their targeting capabilities , but this practice has stoked 
consumer privacy concerns. This study develops a game-theoretic model to examine the economic  
mechanism underlying the partnership between competing platforms and a data broker in a two-sided 
market. Interestingly, our analysis shows that the increase in consumer privacy concerns caused by the 
data broker may incentivize platforms to partner with the data broker  rather than discourag ing them. 
The driving force is that due to negative cross-side network effects, increased privacy concerns can be 
a strategic lever to soften price competition on the advertiser side. However, when both platforms 
partner with the data broker, a prisoner ’s dilemma situation may arise in equilibrium even though the 
data broker can greatly improve the targeting capabilities. We find that the platform-data broker 
partnership hurts consumer surplus when platforms adopt a pure ad-sponsored model without charging 
consumers, but it may benefit consumer surplus when platforms adopt a mixed model with ad-
sponsored and subscription -based revenue. We consider several model extensions to seek additional 
insights, including the data broker charg ing an endogenous commission fee and cases where  the 
consumer or advertiser can multihome (join more than one platform) . Managerial and policy 
implications of the findings are discussed.

1. Introduction 
Data has become a strategic asset for many businesses and industries (DalleMule and Davenport 2017). 
The huge demand for data has spawned an emerging data broker industry , which was valued at USD 
232 billion in 2019 and is expected to reach USD 345 billion in 20261. Major data brokers in the market 
include Acxiom , Experian, Oracle, and Lotame, which actively c ollect consumer data from various 
online and offline sources  (e.g., social media, web history, offline purchase history ). Data brokers 
aggregate and process the collected data to generate consumer insights and then share those with other 
companies for purposes such as targeted advertising and personalized pricing.  
Given the importance of data, online advertising platforms (e.g., Facebook, TikTok, and publisher 
websites) have begun to partner with data brokers (Venkatadri et al. 2019). These platforms are funded 
by digital advertising in a two-sided market, in which they provide online services to consumers while 
collecting consumer data for selling targeted ads to advertisers. By partnering with data brokers , 
platforms can improve their targeting capabilities by acquiring external data and analytic services. For 
instance, Facebook used to partner with several data brokers (e.g., Acxiom, Experion), allowing for the 
data collected online by Facebook to be linked against data collected offline by data brokers. This 
enables platforms to refine their targeting b ased on information compiled by these partners, such as 
offline demographic and behavioral information like addresses, income, and purchase history. Other 
examples include  the partnership between  TikTok and Oracle , where TikTok can  gain better user 
insights by leveraging Oracle’s data analytics service  (Goetzen 2020 ). According to recent media

reports (Lotame 2020), partnering with data brokers has become an important competitive strategy for 
platforms to increase their competitive edge in the advertising market. 
The platform -data broker partnership, while beneficial to advertisers,  may hurt consumers . 
According to a survey by eMarketer (2019 ), 77% of US internet users are concerned that targeted 
advertising based on their personal data may invade privacy. Recently, the emergence of platform-data 
broker partnerships has exacerbated consumer privacy concerns  because the linking of the data from 
two parties may leak more sensitive information about users to advertisers (Venkatadri et al. 2018). In 
line with recent privacy regulations such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and EU’s 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), platforms must disclose with whom they share consumer 
data. Hence, platform-data broker partnerships are much more visible to consumers than ever before. 
However, consumers ar e unclear about whether and how data brokers may utilize their personal data 
for any other purpose. Due to the untransparent operations of the data broker industry, platform -data 
broker partnerships have triggered greater concerns over invasion of privacy (Ram and Murgia 2019; 
Sherman 2020). Moreover, increasingly common data breach incidents have also heightened privacy 
concerns about the platform -data broker partnership. One of the most notorious examples is the 
Facebook Cambridge Analytica Scandal, where Facebook exposed user data to an external data broker 
for political advertising.  Typically, when platforms sell more targeted ads, consumers are more 
vulnerable to privacy invasion as their data may be shared with more advertisers (i.e., negative cross-
side network effects). The increased privacy concern may lead to loss of users  and reduced platform 
usage, which indirectly affect the platforms’ competitiveness on the advertiser si de (i.e., revenue -
generating side). As a consequence, platforms’ ad pricing and advertiser demands may also be affected.

Faced with tremendous pressure from consumer privacy groups and regulatory authorities, some 
platforms have stopped partnering with data brokers (Tau 2020). For instance, Facebook announced it 
would terminate its partnership with data brokers in 201 8 after the Cambridge Analytica Scandal 
(Ingram and Fioretti 2018). Evidently, such a decision is made to save the firm’s image and reputation 
in reaction to a wave of criticism . Nevertheless, when surveying the market, we find that many other 
platforms are still closely partnering with data brokers  to share consumer insights with advertisers or 
marketing agencies. For instance, Snapchat has partnered with Oracle to improve its ad targeting since 
2017 (Maytom 2017). Besides these examples, many publisher websites have partnered with Lotame 
to enhance targeting capabilities. These diverse partnership strategies motivate our investigation of 
platforms’ incentives to partner with the data broker given the potential merits (i.e., improved targeting 
level) and demerits (i.e., increased privacy concerns) in a two-sided market. Moreover, in view of the 
ongoing debate about the data broker industry, it is important to examine the welfare implications of 
platform-data broker partnerships. 
In particular , we address the following research que stions in this study : (i) How does the 
partnership with a data broker affect platforms’ pricing strategies and profits?  (ii) When should 
competing platforms partner with a data broker? (iii) How does the partnership between the data broker 
and platforms affect the consumer surplus, advertiser surplus , and social welfare? To answer the se 
questions, we build a game -theoretic model in which two competing platforms provide service s to 
consumers while selling targeted ads to advertisers.  Partnering with the data broker can improve 
platforms’ targeting capabilities, but it also invokes greater consumer privacy concerns, and platforms 
need to pay a commission to the data broker for each ad sale. In the main model, we assume platforms

adopt a pure ad -sponsored model without charging consumers . In the extension, we consider the case 
where platforms adopt a mixed model of subscription -based (i.e., charge consumers a price) and ad-
sponsored revenue. We also consider other extensions in which the data broker set s the commission 
rate endogenously, and the consumers or advertisers can join multiple platforms (i.e., multihoming).  
Our analysis yields several interesting and important insights. First, we find that the increase in 
consumer privacy concerns caused by data broker s may incentivize rather than discourag e platforms 
from partnering with the data broker. This counterintuitive result can be explained from the perspective 
of the negative cross-side network effect in two-sided markets. To elaborate, when partnering with the 
data broker invokes greater privacy concerns about targeted advertising, platforms are compelled  to 
compete for advertisers less aggressively to avoid consumer churn. Hence, both platforms will charge 
a higher ad price, which softens the price competition and leads to higher profits. This result has an 
important implication: increased privacy concerns caused by platform-data broker partnership can be 
a strategic lever to soften price competition on the advertiser side. This privacy concern-induced higher 
price is consistent with trends observed in the industry. In practice, many publishers are trying to 
increase ad prices and reduce the number of ads in response to consumers’ growing privacy concerns 
about targeted ads , which has proven to boost revenue for some publishers (Bishop 2018; Marshall 
2017). Our research provides a possible ex planation of why platform -data broker partnerships still 
prevail in the market despite growing consumer privacy concerns about data brokers. 
Another important factor motivating the platforms to partner with the data broker is that the latter 
can help improve platform targeting capabilities, which aligns with our expectation s. However, it is 
intriguing to find that partnering with the data broker may lead to a prisoner’s dilemma for platforms ;

that is, platforms may be worse off than if they  both commit not to partner with the data broker. This 
happens when the data broker induces high, but not too high, privacy concerns. In this case, platform 
competition will be eased, but not substantially, so the incremental revenue from partnering with the 
data broker cannot compensate for the commissions paid to the data broker. This result resonates well 
with recent field studies and industrial reports, which indicate that although partnering with a data 
broker can increase platforms’ competitive advantage in targeting capabilities, their profits may even 
decrease because the data broker extracts a large proportion of ad revenue (CMA 2020; Neumann 2019). 
Overall, our findings confirm that platforms should carefully assess consumer privacy concerns about 
data brokers and the commission charged by the data broker before making such partnership decisions.  
Our results also reveal important welfare implications by examining consumer surplus, advertiser 
surplus, and social welfare. We find that the platform’s business model plays a crucial role in whether 
partnering with data broker benefit s or hurts consumers. When platforms adopt a pure ad -sponsored 
model, partnering with a data broker always hurt s consumers due to  the increased privacy concerns. 
However, when platforms adopt a mixed model of subscription -based and ad -sponsored revenue, a 
platform-data broker partnership can benefit consumers because it will intensify the price competition 
on the consumer side, resulting in a lower consumer price and thus higher consumer surplus. The caveat 
here is that although the ad-sponsored model does not charge consumers, it can harm them in the context 
of platform -data broker partnership s. Hence, policymakers should take into account the platform’s 
business model when scrutinizing the impact of platform-data broker partnerships on consumer surplus. 
Looking at advertiser surplus and social welfare, we show that advertisers and society can be better off 
when the improvement in targeting capabilities outweighs the increase in consumer privacy concerns.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We review relevant literature in Section 2. In 
Section 3, we describe our model framework, followed by the model analysis and the equilibrium results 
about platforms’ partnership strategies in Section 4. Section 5 extends the model with several alternative 
model setups. Finally, the paper concludes in Section 6 with a discussion of managerial implications, 
limitations of the study, and future research directions.  
2. Literature Review 
This study relates to the growing literature on two-sided platform markets. Starting with pioneer works 
by Caillaud and Jullien (2003) and Rochet and Tirole (2003), a  rapidly increasing number of studies 
have investigated pricing strategies for two-sided platforms (Armstrong 2006; Hagiu 2009; Parker and 
Van Alstyne 2005; Rochet and Tirole 2006). Given the presence of cross-side network effects, a major 
implication from these studies is that platforms can maximize profits by subsidizing one side and 
charging a high price on the other side. This result is derive d in the setting where both sides of two-
sided platforms  singlehome (i.e., agents on both sides are allowed to join only one platform ) 
(Belleflamme and Peitz 2019 ), or where agents on one side singlehome and the other side can 
multihome (i.e., join multiple platforms); the latter setting is called a competitive bottleneck (Armstrong 
2006; Armstrong and Wright 2007 ). In the setting where agents on both sides multihome, however, 
Bakos and Halaburda (2020) show that it may not be optimal for platforms to subsidize one side because 
there is no strategic interdependence between two sides in this case. Most research in this stream 
considers that both sides of the market have positive cross-side network effects on the other side. In our 
context, cross -side network effects are positive in one direction (i.e., consumers to advertisers) but 
negative in the other due to privacy concerns (i.e., advertisers and data brokers to consumers).

Some studies examine the implications of nonprice factors on platform competition under cross-
side network effects (Hagiu and Spulber 2013; Anderson et al. 2014; Dou and Wu 2021). For instance, 
Hagiu and Spulber (2013) examine platform incentives to invest in first -party content as a strategic 
nonprice control and how such content interacts with the platforms’ pricing strategies.  Dou and Wu 
(2021) investigate how piggybacking, in which platforms can import exclusive external users , affects 
platforms’ optimal pricing and subsidization strategies. The current study contributes to this literature 
by introducing the partnership with data broker s as a nonprice control for platforms and showing the 
interplay between cross-side network effects and price competition.  
Recently, some studies have focused on two -sided media markets (e.g., Ambrus et al. 2016 ; 
Anderson et al. 2018;  Athey et al. 2014 ), which are closer to our research context.  One of the studies 
most relevant to ours is Gopal et al. (2018), which examines the impact of privacy concerns on publisher 
websites’ incentives to share user information with third parties (e.g., advertisers). In their model, third 
parties generate negative network effects on the consumer side , driven by user privacy concerns as in 
Casadesus-Masanell and Hervas-Drane (2015). Although we also consider consumer privacy concerns, 
our study departs from theirs in that we focus on the partnership between platforms and the data broker 
as a strategic  variable for platforms. We characterize the conditions when partnering with the data 
broker can improve profit and when it leads to a prisoner’s dilemma outcome for platforms. Moreover, 
in Gopal et al. (2018), platforms charge prices from both sides  (advertisers and consumers), and there 
is no competition on the advertiser side. In contrast, in our setting, platforms can adopt an ad-sponsored 
model without charging consumers, and we model the platform competition on the advertiser side.

This study also contributes to the literature on online data markets (Bergemann and Bonatti 2019), 
in which data brokers play a strategic role in deciding how to sell data to downstream firms (e.g., 
advertising platforms in this study ). Prior literature examines data brokers’ data sharing strategies in 
various contexts, where data can be used to price discriminate (Bounie et al. 2021; Braulin and Valletti 
2016; Montes et al. 2019 ), predict market demand ( Bimpikis et al. 2019), and improve consumer 
targeting (Bergemann, and Bonatti 2015; Zhang et al. 2020). Different from these papers that focus on 
a one-sided market where the interactions between firms and consumers are considered, we focus on a 
two-sided market where the platform-data broker partnership benefits the advertiser side but hurts the 
consumer side . Our study sheds light on the implications of platform -data broker partnership on 
different stakeholders, including platforms, advertisers, consumers, and the data broker.  
Finally, this study broadens the literature on the economics of privacy (see Acquisti et al. 2016 for 
a comprehensive literature survey). A recent strand of literature examines the implications of consumer 
privacy in the context of price discrimination (Chen et al. 2020; Conitzer et al. 2012) and personalized 
service provision (Chellappa and Shivendu 2010). Close to our context, several papers examine the 
impact of privacy concerns when platforms collect consumer data for targeted advertising. For instance, 
Gal-Or et al. (2018) study the role of privacy concerns on  platform competition, finding that a higher 
privacy concern can intensify platform competition because it reduces the targeting differentiation of 
competing platforms. Dimakopoulos and Sudaric (2018) examine how privacy concerns and platform 
competition affect platforms’ decisions on how much data to collect. They find that the data collection 
level can be inefficiently high if the competition is weak. Our study contributes to this literature by 
examining how consumer privacy concerns affect the partnership between platforms and the data broker,

which is a growing trend in practice but rarely studied. Our analysis provides insights into the economic 
mechanisms that explain the platform-data broker partnership.  
3. Model  
We consider a two-sided market consisting of three types of players, i.e., two symmetric competing 
platforms (denoted by 𝑖 = 𝐴, 𝐵), a unit mass of consumers, and a unit mass of advertisers. Platforms 
provide services to consumers while collecting their data and selling targeted ads to advertisers. Thus, 
platforms compete for both the consumer side (called the 𝑋 side) and the advertiser side (called the 𝑌 
side). Following the prior literature (Bakos and Halaburda 2020; Dimakopoulos and Sudaric 2018), we 
employ a two -sided Hotelling model to capture the competition between platforms. Specifically, 
consumers and advertisers are uniformly distributed along two Hotelling lines , i.e., 𝑥~𝑈[0,1] for the 
𝑋 side, 𝑦~𝑈[0,1] for the 𝑌 side. Platforms are located at the endpoints of the two Hotelling lines, 
with platform 𝐴 being at 0 and platform 𝐵 being at 1. In the main model, we assume both consumers 
and advertisers singlehome. In the extension, we consider the case where consumers or advertisers can 
multihome. Below, we describe the platform profits, consumer utility, and advertiser payoff.  
3.1. Platforms 
By analyzing consumer data, platforms can learn  consumer preferences and build consumer profiles. 
These insights and knowledge enable the platform to develop targeting capabilities to find relevant 
consumers, thereby attracting advertisers to purchase ad slots on their platforms. We denote platforms’ 
baseline targeting capabilities as 𝛽. Typically, a higher targeting capability can increase advertisers’ 
willingness to pay for a higher ad price. In the main model, we assume platforms adopt a pure ad-
sponsored business model  without charging consumers, which is commonly adopted by many

=== PAGE 12 / 39 ===

12 
advertising platforms (e.g., Facebook and YouTube). In Section 5 .1, we also consider platforms 
adopting a mixed model with both ad-sponsored and subscription-based revenue. 
To further improve targeting capabilities, platforms can partner with data brokers who collect a 
wide variety of consumer data from online and offline sources. For instance, Facebook used to partner 
with several data brokers (e.g., Ac xiom, Experion, and Oracle), allowing for the data collected online 
by Facebook to be linked to data collected offline by data brokers. This partnership enables platforms 
to refine their targeting based on information compiled by these partners, such as offline demographic 
and behavioral information like homeownership or purchase history. As a result, after partnering with 
the data broker, the platforms’ targeting capability can be enhanced, which is denoted by 𝛽 + 𝛿, where 
𝛿 is the targeting improvement enabled by the data broker.  
Note that when platforms partner with the data broker to improve targeting capabilities, platforms 
pay a commission to the data broker (i.e., a proportion of advertising revenue), which can be considered 
as a referral fee . The commission rate is denoted by 𝛾, and we assume 𝛾 is not too high to ensure 
platforms have incentives to partner with the data broker. In practice, such a revenue-sharing model is 
widely used between platforms and data brokers (CMA 2020). Platforms can choose whether to partner 
with the data broker, denoted by 𝑌 (partner) or 𝑁 (not partner). Table 1 summarize s the platforms’ 
decision matrix. There are four different partnerships between platforms and the data broker. The first 
(second) argument at each strategy profile represents the platform A’s (B’s) decision.

The platforms’ profit functions are as follows, (i) when the platform 𝑖 does not partner with the 
data broker, 𝜋𝑖 = 𝑝𝑖𝐷𝑖 ; (ii) when the platform 𝑖 partners with the data broker, 𝜋𝑖 = (1 − 𝛾)𝑝𝑖𝐷𝑖 , 
where 𝑝𝑖 is the ad price charged for advertisers, 𝐷𝑖  is platform 𝑖’s advertiser demand, and 𝛾 is the 
commission rate. In the main model, we assume the commission rate is exogenous. In Section 5.2, we 
consider the case of the data broker deciding the commission rate endogenously.  
3.2. Consumers 
Consumers derive a value  (denoted by 𝑣𝑐) from consuming the platforms’ content services. In this 
process, platforms collect consumer data such as names, contact details, search history, IP address es, 
and number of clicks. Platforms may share the data with advertisers to help advertisers deliver targeted 
ads to consumers, which has infringed on consumer privacy (Mayer and Mitchell 2012). A recent survey 
indicates that the majority of respondents resent targeted ads due to perceived privacy intrusions2. Thus, 
although the service is free of charge, consumers incur privacy costs when using the platforms’ service.  
Following the prior literature (Lin 202 2), we consider two components of a consumer ’s privacy 
cost: (i) intrinsic privacy cost  (denoted by 𝜅), which reflects a consumer’s intrinsic preference for 
privacy, and (ii) variable privacy cost, which relates to how much consumer information is disclosed to 
other firms. For variable privacy cost, as platforms sell targeted ads to more advertisers, consumers will 
perceive a higher disutility as their information is more likely to be leaked to more third parties (King 
2019; Tucker 2012). Therefore, consistent with Gopal et al. (2018), we model the consumers’ variable 
privacy cost caused by targeted advertising as 𝛼𝑦𝑖, where 𝛼 denotes the consumer privacy concerns, 
and 𝑦𝑖 represents the number of advertisers served by platform 𝑖.

14 
As we mentioned before, platforms can choose to partner with the data broker to improve their ad 
targeting capabilities. Typically, platforms and data brokers share the data they have with each other to 
generate more fine-grained targeting features regarding consumers (Venkatadri et al. 2019). From the 
consumers’ perspective, however, such a partnership will exacerbate privacy concerns about targeted 
advertising because more sensitive information can be leaked to advertisers or third parties without 
consumer control (Molitorisz 2018) . For instance, in the Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal, 
Facebook was severely criticized by consumer privacy groups  for sharing consumer data with third -
party data brokers  for political advertising . Therefore, when partnering with the data broker, the 
consumers’ privacy concerns will be higher, which we denote as 𝛼 + 𝜌, where 𝜌 is the increase in 
privacy concerns caused by the data broker3.  
Taking all these aspects together,  a consu mer located at 𝑥 will obtain the utility 𝑈𝑖(𝑥) when 
adopting platform 𝑖:  
𝑈𝐴(𝑥) = 𝑣𝑐 − 𝜅 − (𝛼 + 𝕀𝐴𝜌)𝑦𝐴 − 𝑡𝑥,  
𝑈𝐵(𝑥) = 𝑣𝑐 − 𝜅 − (𝛼 + 𝕀𝐵𝜌)𝑦𝐵 − 𝑡(1 − 𝑥) 
where 𝑣𝑐 is the intrinsic service value, which is assumed to be the same for both platforms (Anderson 
Jr et al. 2014). The second term 𝜅 denotes the consumers’ intrinsic privacy cost. The third term (𝛼 +
𝕀𝐴𝜌)𝑦𝐴 ((𝛼 + 𝕀𝐵𝜌)𝑦𝐵) represents the privacy costs caused by targeted advertising and the data broker4, 
 
3 Since, in our context, the platform -data broker partnership mainly affects  the ad targeting process, we focus on the impact 
of this partnership on consumers’ variable privacy cost incurred from targeted advertising. However, it should be noted that 
our key insights remain unchanged if platforms-data broker partnership also increases intrinsic privacy cost. 
4 Note that consumer disutility from advertisements can also be interpreted along other dimensions, such as the nuisance cost. 
Given that platforms increasingly display targeted ads based on consumer data, empirical evidence shows that perceived 
privacy intrusions have become a primary cause of consumer disutility (Mckeon 2019). Hence, in our context, we follow the 
literature to interpret this disutility as a consumer privacy concern (Gopal et al. 2018).

=== PAGE 15 / 39 ===

15 
and 𝕀𝐴 (𝕀𝐵) is an indicator function that equals one if platform 𝐴 (𝐵) partners with the data broker and 
zero otherwise. This specification implies that the consumers’ privacy cost increase s when platforms 
sell targeted ads to more advertisers (Gopal et al. 2018 ; Mckeon 2019 ), which reflects the negative 
cross-side network effects on the consumer s ide. The expressions 𝑡𝑥 and 𝑡(1 − 𝑥) denote the misfit 
cost for a consumer at 𝑥 to adopt platform 𝐴 and 𝐵. When 𝑡 increases, consumers are less willing to 
switch between platforms, so 𝑡 can also measure the degree of competition intensity, with a higher 𝑡 
indicating that the competition is less intense on the consumer side (Anderson et al. 2014).  
3.3. Advertisers 
Advertisers derive benefits from displaying ads on platforms. Such benefits depend on the platforms’ 
targeting capabilities and the number of consumers on the platform. Formally, an advertiser located at 
𝑦 will obtain the following payoff 𝑈𝑖 (𝑦) when displaying an ad on platform 𝐴 or platform 𝐵: 
𝑈𝐴(𝑦) = 𝑣𝑠 + (𝛽 + 𝕀𝐴𝛿)𝑥𝐴 − 𝑝𝐴 − 𝜃𝑦 
𝑈𝐵(𝑦) = 𝑣𝑠 + (𝛽 + 𝕀𝐵𝛿)𝑥𝐵 − 𝑝𝐵 − 𝜃(1 − 𝑦) 
where 𝑣𝑠 represents the standalone value advertisers can derive from adopting the platform. Here, 
(𝛽 + 𝕀𝑖𝛿) represents platform 𝑖’s targeting capabilities, 𝕀𝑖 is the indicator function used to indicate 
whether platform 𝑖 partners with the data broker, and 𝑥𝑖 is the number of consumers adopting  that 
platform. Hence, (𝛽 + 𝕀𝑖𝛿) 𝑥𝑖 can be considered as the fraction of users that can be targeted by platform 
𝑖. The ad price charged by platform 𝑖 is 𝑝𝑖. Finally, 𝜃𝑦 and 𝜃(1 − 𝑦) denote the advertisers’ misfit 
cost, where 𝜃 can measure the competition intensity on the advertiser side. Note that as the number of 
consumers increases, advertisers will obtain a higher payoff, which reflects the positive cross -side 
network effects on the advertiser side.

As illustrated in Figure 1, the timeline of the model has three stages. In stage 1, competing 
platforms decide whether to partner with the data broker. In stage 2, the platforms determine the price 
for advertisers simultaneously. In stage 3, both consumers and advertisers decide which platform to join 
based on the platforms’ pricing and partnering decisions in stage 1 and stage 2.  
4. Equilibrium Analysis 
We use the backward induction approach to derive the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. Based on 
platforms’ decisions in stage 1 (i.e., 𝑌 or 𝑁), there are four subgames: (𝑁, 𝑁), (𝑌, 𝑁), (𝑁, 𝑌), (𝑌, 𝑌). 
Since the platforms are symmetric, (𝑌, 𝑁) is equivalent to (𝑁, 𝑌), so we will focus on the (𝑌, 𝑁) case. 
We first determine platforms’ pricing equilibrium in stage 2 in Section 4.1. Then, in Section 4.2, by 
comparing three subgames, we examine which can be the equilibrium in stage 1.  
4.1. Platforms’ pricing decisions in stage 2 
4.1.1. When neither platform partners with the data broker (𝑵, 𝑵) 
We begin by analyzing the case where neither platform partners with the data broker (i.e., 𝕀𝐴 = 0, 𝕀𝐵 =
0 ). By solving 𝑈𝐴
𝑁𝑁(𝑥)|𝕀𝐴=0 = 𝑈𝐵
𝑁𝑁(𝑥)|𝕀𝐵=0 , 𝑈𝐴
𝑁𝑁(𝑦)|𝕀𝐴=0 = 𝑈𝐵
𝑁𝑁(𝑦)|𝕀𝐵=0 , we can derive the 
indifferent consumer type 𝑥𝑁𝑁∗ and the indifferent advertiser type 𝑦𝑁𝑁∗: 𝑥𝑁𝑁∗ =
𝑡+𝛼−2𝛼𝑦𝐴
2𝑡 , 𝑦𝑁𝑁∗ =
2𝛽𝑥𝐴−𝑝𝐴+𝑝𝐵+𝜃−𝛽

There are several observations from Lemma 1. First, it is interesting to find that wh en consumer 
privacy concerns (𝛼) increase, platforms charge a higher ad price and obtain higher profits. This result 
is driven by the negative cross -side network effects on the consumer side. When 𝛼  increases, 
consumers are more sensitive to targeted advertising due to higher privacy concerns. To avoid the loss 
of consumers, which is important for the advertiser side, platforms have incentives to limit the number 
of advertisers. Here, increasing ad prices is an effective way to control the advertiser  demand, so both 
platforms would choose to increase ad prices, which softens the price competition on the advertiser side 
and leads to higher profits.  Second, when platforms’ targeting capabilities increase ( 𝛽), platforms can 
charge a higher price and achieve higher profits. This is because a higher targeting capability brings 
more value to advertisers, which enhances their willingness to pay.  
Further, we find that the platforms’ prices increase with advertiser side misfit cost (𝜃). This result 
is expected because a higher 𝜃 implies that the competition intensity on the advertiser side is less 
intense. However, interestingly, when the misfit cost of the consumer side (𝑡) increases, platform prices 
and profits decrease. This happens because when 𝑡 increases, consumers have a stronger preference 
between the two platforms. In this case, having more advertisers on the platform would not drive many 
consumers to switch to the rival platform. Hence, platforms have incentives to reduce the ir prices to 
attract more advertisers, which, in turn, intensifies the price competition, resulting in lower prices and

profits. This result implies that a less -competitive environment on the consumer side can lead to more 
intense competition on the advertiser side. This finding differs from the prior literature that assumes 
platforms conduct two -sided pricing (Bakos and Halaburda 2020; Dou and Wu 2021); those studies 
show that one side’s misfit cost only affects the price of the same side, not the price of the opposite side.  
4.1.2. When only one platform partners with the data broker (𝒀, 𝑵) 
We now consider an asymmetric partnership decision by the two platforms. Without loss of generality, 
we assume platform 𝐴 partners with the data broker while platform 𝐵 does not (i.e., 𝕀𝐴 = 1, 𝕀𝐵 =
0). In this case, the platform’s targeting capabilities will be improved, but the consumers’ privacy 
concerns increase when using platform 𝐴. By solving 𝑈𝐴
𝑌𝑁(𝑥)|𝕀𝐴=1 = 𝑈𝐵
𝑌𝑁(𝑥)|𝕀𝐵=0, 𝑈𝐴
𝑌𝑁(𝑦)|𝕀𝐴=1 =
𝑈𝐵
𝑌𝑁(𝑦)|𝕀𝐵=0, we can derive the indifferent  consumer type 𝑥𝑌𝑁∗ and the indifferent advertiser type

Based on Lemma 2, the following corollary summarizes the comparative static analysis of the increased 
privacy concerns 𝜌 and the improvement in targeting capabilities 𝛿 induced by the data broker.  
Corollary 1. When only platform A partners with the data broker, the equilibrium outcomes have the 
following properties:

We derive several important insights from Lemma 2 and Corollary 1. First, when partnering with 
the data broker, the increase in con sumer privacy concerns (i.e., 𝜌) incentivizes the platform 𝐴 to 
increase its price. Foreseeing the price increase of platform 𝐴, platform 𝐵 can also increase its price 
accordingly (See Figure 2(a)). Interestingly, we find that platform 𝐵’s price has a higher increasing rate 
as 𝜌 increases (i.e., 
𝜕𝑝𝐵
𝑌𝑁∗
𝜕𝜌 >
𝜕𝑝𝐴
𝑌𝑁∗
𝜕𝜌 > 0). This is because  when 𝜌 increases, platform 𝐴 will lose 
consumers due to the higher increase in privacy concerns, while platform 𝐵 will gain consumers. Given 
the presence of cross-side network effects, platform 𝐵 provides relatively high value on the advertiser 
side, which enable s platform 𝐵 to increase its price more. We show that when 𝜌 is greater than a 
threshold (i.e., 𝜌 >
2𝑡𝛿
2𝛽+𝛿), platform 𝐵’s price is even higher than that of platform 𝐴.  
  
 
 
 
 
Second, when 𝜌 increases, we find that platform 𝐵’s profit always increases while platform 𝐴’s 
profit first decreases and then increases. The reason is that while platform 𝐴’s price increases with 𝜌, 
its advertiser demand decreases with 𝜌. We find that the price increase can compensate for the demand 
loss, resulting in a higher profit, only when 𝜌 is relatively large. This result indicates that a U-shaped 
relationship exists between platform 𝐴’s profits and the increase in consumer privacy concerns  (see 
Figure 2. The impact of 𝜌 on platforms’ prices and profits

Figure 2(b)). Intriguingly, when 𝜌 is relatively low, partnering with the data broker may lead to a lower 
profit for platform 𝐴 even though its targeting capability is improved. This result implies that, in a two-
sided market, a competitive advantag e on one side of the market does not necessarily lead to a higher 
overall performance.   
4.1.3. When both platforms partner with the data broker (𝒀, 𝒀) 
In this subsection, we analyze the case where both platforms partner with the data broker (i.e., 𝕀𝐴 = 1, 
𝕀𝐵 = 1). By solving 𝑈𝐴
𝑌𝑌(𝑥)|𝕀𝐴=1 = 𝑈𝐵
𝑌𝑌(𝑥)|𝕀𝐵=1, 𝑈𝐴
𝑌𝑌(𝑦)|𝕀𝐴=1 = 𝑈𝐵
𝑌𝑌(𝑦)|𝕀𝐵=1, we can derive the 
indifferent consumer type 𝑥𝑌𝑌∗  and t he indifferent advertiser type 𝑦𝑌𝑌∗ : 𝑥𝑌𝑌∗ =
𝑡+𝛼+𝜌−2(𝛼+𝜌)𝑦𝐴

𝑦𝑌𝑌∗ =

𝜋𝐵
𝑌𝑌 = (1 − 𝛾)𝑝𝐵
𝑌𝑌(1 − 𝑦𝑌𝑌∗). By maximizing the platforms’ profit functions, we can derive the 
equilibrium prices and profits in the (𝑌, 𝑌) case.  
Lemma 3. When both platforms partner with the data broker, the platforms’ equilibrium ad prices and 
profits are: 𝑝𝐴
𝑌𝑌∗ = 𝑝𝐵
𝑌𝑌∗ =
(𝛼+𝜌)(𝛽+𝛿)
𝑡 + 𝜃, 𝜋𝐴
𝑌𝑌∗ = 𝜋𝐵
𝑌𝑌∗ =

2 (1 − 𝛾)(
(𝛼+𝜌)(𝛽+𝛿)
𝑡 + 𝜃). 
Compared to the  (𝑁, 𝑁) case, Lemma 3 states that when both platforms partner with the data 
broker, the platforms’ equilibrium prices are higher. This is because the partnership with the data broker 
increases consumer privacy conce rns by 𝜌, which incentivizes the platform to charge a higher price. 
Moreover, the platforms’ targeting capabilities also increase by 𝛿, which  increases the advertisers’ 
willingness to pay a higher price. The higher price helps platforms generate higher revenue from selling 
ads to advertisers , but the platforms must pay a commission fee to the data broker. Therefore, it is 
unclear whether the platforms’ net profits will be higher after partnering with the data broker.

4.2. Platforms’ partnership strategies in stage 1 
So far, we have analyzed the platforms’ equilibrium prices and profits in each subgame. In this section, 
by comparing platform profits across different subgames, we examine the equilibrium outcomes of the 
competing platforms’ partnership decisions.  
Proposition 1. In equilibrium, the platforms’ partnership strategies are as follows, 
(i) when 0 < 𝜌 < 𝜌1 (0 < 𝛿 < 𝛿1), the equilibrium is neither platform partnering with the data 
broker, i.e., (𝑁, 𝑁); 
(ii) when 𝜌1 < 𝜌 < 𝜌2 (𝛿1 < 𝛿 < 𝛿2), the equilibrium is only one platform partner ing with the 
data broker, i.e., (𝑌, 𝑁) or (𝑁, 𝑌); 
(iii) when 𝜌 > 𝜌2 (𝛿 > 𝛿2), the equilibrium is both platforms partnering with the data broker, i.e., 
(𝑌, 𝑌); 
where the expressions of 𝛿1, 𝛿2, 𝜌1, and 𝜌2 are presented in the Appendix. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The results of Proposition 1 are illustrated in Figure 3, highlighting the interactive effects of the 
increased privacy concerns 𝜌  and targeting improvement 𝛿  on platforms’ partnership strategies. 
Interestingly, platforms are more likely to partner with the data broker when the increase in consumer 
𝜌

22 
privacy concerns is large. As shown in Figure 3, for a given 𝛿 (e.g., 𝛿 = 0.5), when 𝜌 increases (see 
the vertical arrow in Figure 3), the equilibrium switches from (𝑁, 𝑁), to (𝑌, 𝑁), to (𝑌, 𝑌). Intuitively, 
when partnering with the data broker lead s to higher privacy concerns, we might expect platforms to 
forego this partnership as it would lead to a loss of consumers on the consumer side, which indirectly 
hurt the platform’s profits on the advertiser side. However, our result shows that this intuition does not 
hold. The mechanism is that when the data broker triggers greater privacy concerns, consumers ’ 
negative perception towards targeted ads increases. To prevent consumer churn, platform s have 
incentives to compete for advertisers less aggressively, resulting in higher ad prices and higher profits. 
An implication of this finding is that increased privacy concerns can be a strategic tool leveraged by 
platforms to soften price competition on the advertiser side. Our finding echoes recent market trends 
observed in the industry. As consumers become increasingly concerned that targeted advertising would 
invade privacy, anecdotes show that publishers are trying to increase ad prices and reduce the number 
of ads, which has been proved to benefit the publisher’s revenue (Bishop 2018; Marshall 2017). 
As a result,  when 𝜌 increases from small  to moderate value, one platform will start partnering 
with the data broker because this change can reduce price competition and improve its targeting 
capability. Meanwhile, the other platform still does not partner with the data broker because avoiding 
the partnership can help attract more consumers and thus attract more advertisers. This leads to an 
asymmetric partnership strategy for two symmetric platforms. Finally, when 𝜌 becomes large, the other 
platform will also benefit from partnering with the data broker, which allows the platform to charge a 
higher price, further mitigating the price competition.  Due to the effect of relaxed competition, our 
analysis reveals that a h igher privacy concern induced by the data broker would prompt rather than

23 
hinder the platform -data broker partnership. This finding provides a possible explanation of why 
platform-data broker partnerships still prevail in the market despite growing consumer privacy concerns 
about the data broker. 
When examining the  equilibrium conditions in terms of  𝛿 , we find that  when the targeting 
improvement is greater, the platforms are more likely to partner with the data broker. As shown in 
Figure 3 (see the horizontal arrow), for a given 𝜌 (e.g., 𝜌 = 0.4), as 𝛿 increases, the equilibrium 
switches from ( 𝑁, 𝑁), to ( 𝑌, 𝑁), to ( 𝑌, 𝑌). This result is in line with our expectation s because the 
improvement in targeting capabilities increases the targeting benefits to advertisers, allowing platforms 
to charge a higher price. This result resonates with some case studies demonstrating that partnering with 
a data broker can help publisher websites increase their CMPs (cost-per-thousand impressions). For 
instance, a data broker called Zeotap partnered with a leading EU publisher to develop advanced 
audience targeting options, allowing the publisher to obtain 28% higher CPMs from advertisers5. 
Overall, our findings reveal two underlying mechanisms to explain the partnership between 
platforms and the data broker. First, the growing privacy concerns about the data broker industry may 
prompt platforms to partner with the data broker. Second, the data broker’s data advantage and superior 
analytics capabilities, which can improve the targeting significantly, will also drive platforms to partner 
with the data broker. 
Despite the growing popularity of the partnership between platforms and the data broker, a natural 
and important question is whether such a partnership increases the profit compared to the case where 
both platforms do not partner with the data broker. We examine this issue in the following proposition.

Proposition 2. When 𝜌2 < 𝜌 < 𝜌3, both platforms partnering with the data broker is a prisoner’s 
dilemma situation, where 𝜌3 =
𝛼(𝛾(𝛽+𝛿)−𝛿)+𝑡𝛾𝜃
(1−𝛾)(𝛽+𝛿) . 
Proposition 2 shows that after partnering with the data broker, platforms may be worse off than if 
neither one partners with the data broker, leading to a prisoner’s dilemma outcome. This result occurs 
when the increase in consumer privacy concerns is relatively high but not high enough to ease 
competition to a large extent (i.e., 𝜌2 < 𝜌 < 𝜌3). When 𝜌 is relatively high (i.e., 𝜌 > 𝜌2), partnership 
with the data broker is the dominant strategy for both platforms because the data broker can help 
improve the targeting capabilities, and the increase in consumer privacy concerns can ease price 
competition. However, as each platform partners with the data broker, the competitive advantage in the 
advertiser market weakens. Besides, unlike the case where platforms do not partner with the data broker, 
platforms must pay a commission fee to the data broker, i.e., share their advertising revenue. We show 
that when the increase in consumer privacy concerns is not very high (i.e., 𝜌 < 𝜌3), the incremental 
revenue due to a high price cannot offset the commission paid to the data broker. Consequently, both 
platforms receive a lower profit. This finding is supported by a recent field study showing that while it 
is prevalent for platforms to partner with a data broker, doing so can harm the platforms’ profit when 
the third-party data cost is high (Neumann 2019).  
Note that the threshold 𝜌3  increases with the consumer side and advertiser side misfit cost 
parameters (𝑡, 𝜃) and the commission rate (𝛾). This implies that the prisoner’s dilemma is more likely 
to happen when the competition on the consumer side or the advertiser side is less intense and when 
platforms need to pay a high commission fee. The intuition is that weaker competition on the consumer 
side intensifies the price competition on the advertiser side, and this adverse effect is more prominent

25 
when both platforms partner with the data broker. Besides this, when the advertiser side competition is 
less intense, the benefits of partnering with the data broker decrease. Therefore, although platforms 
currently are keen to partner with a data broker to improve their targeting capabilities, such a partnership 
may hurt them, especially when no fierce competition exists on both sides (consumer and advertiser), 
and the data broker has high bargaining power over the commission rate. Some industrial examples 
confirm the potential perils of partnering with the data broker. For instance, many publishers believe 
that partnering with Google Analytics 360 (Google’s data service) indeed will improve their 
competitive advantage in targeting capabilities, but their profits may decrease because Google often 
charges a high fee for its data service in targeted advertising due to its dominant position (CMA 2020).  
4.3. Welfare implications of the partnership between platforms and the data broker  
Given that the partnership between platforms and the data broker significantly affects both the consumer 
side and advertiser side, another important question is how such a partnership affects consumer surplus, 
advertiser surplus, and social welfare. In this section, we examine this issue by comparing these welfare 
outcomes in the scenario where platforms do not partner with the data broker  (i.e., (𝑁, 𝑁)) with the 
scenario where both platforms partner with the data broker (i.e., (𝑌, 𝑌)).  
Proposition 3. Compared to the scenario where platforms do not partner with the data broker, when 
both platforms partner with the data broker,  
(i) consumer surplus decreases; 
(ii) advertiser surplus increases when 𝜌 is small (i.e., 𝜌 <
(𝑡−2𝛼)𝛿
2(𝛽+𝛿) ) and decreases when 𝜌 is 
large (i.e., 𝜌 >
(𝑡−2𝛼)𝛿
2(𝛽+𝛿) ); 
(iii) social welfare increases when 𝛿 > 𝜌 and decreases when 𝛿 < 𝜌. 
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4189518

=== PAGE 26 / 39 ===

26 
The results of Proposition 3 are illustrated in Figure 4. The implications are the following. First, 
we show that the partnership between  platforms and the data broker always hurts consumer surplus. 
This is because  such a partnership  increases consumer privacy concerns. The increase in privacy 
concerns, such as perceived higher risks of data breaches, makes consumers bear a higher privacy cost, 
resulting in a lower consumer surplus. Note that in the main model, we do not consider the price on the 
consumer side, so the consumer surplus is not affected by platforms’ pricing decisions. As we show in 
Section 5.1, when we incorporate a consumer-side price, the partnership between the platforms and data 
broker can benefit consumer surplus because the consumer price may decrease.  
Second, when the increase in consumer privacy concerns c aused by the data broke r is small, the 
partnership between platforms and the data broker benefits advertiser surplus (see region I in Figure 4). 
There are two opposite effects at play. On the one hand, the partnership can improve the platforms’ 
targeting capabilities, which positively affects the advertiser surplus. On the other hand, the partnership 
leads platforms to charge a high price to the advertiser due to relaxed competition , which negatively 
affects the advertiser surplus. We show that when 𝜌 is small, the former effect dominates, leading to a 
𝛿 
𝜌 
Figure 4. The welfare implications of platform-data broker partnership

=== PAGE 27 / 39 ===

27 
net increase in advertiser surplus. In contrast, when 𝜌 is large, the platform charges a much higher price, 
which makes the latter effect dominate the former, resulting in a net decrease in advertiser surplus (see 
regions II and III in Figure 4). 
Finally, from the whole society perspective, we find that partnerships between platforms and data 
brokers can improve social welfare if the targeting improvement outweighs the increase in consumer 
privacy concerns (see regions I and II in Figure 4). This result implies that the emerging data broker 
industry may not be a scourge to society  if consumer privacy issue s can be addressed. However, it is 
worth noting that in region II, the platform -data broker partnership increases social welfare , but 
decreases consumer surplus and advertiser surplus. In practice, policymakers can require data brokers 
to be more transparent about their operations, for example, to obtain consumers’ consent before using 
their data. Overall, our finding cautions that the policymakers should scrutinize the platform-data broker 
partnership carefully because the platform -data broker partnership may improve social welfare at the 
expense of consumer surplus and advertiser surplus. 
4.4. Platforms’ privacy protection strategies 
In the previous sections, we have examined the impact of platform-data broker partnership on platform 
profits and welfare outcomes.  Faced with growing privacy concerns, platforms have started to take 
measures (e.g., restrict ing access, firewalls , and encryption protection)  to protect the consumers’ 
personal data  and reduce their privacy concern s. Moreover, recent privacy regulation s (e.g., GDPR, 
CCPA) also put pressure on  firms to protect consumer privacy. In this subsection, we examine the 
platforms’ motivation for privacy protection when they both establish a partnership with the data broker. 
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4189518

=== PAGE 28 / 39 ===

28 
In particular, we investigate whether and when competing platforms have incenti ves to adopt high or 
low levels of privacy protection.  
We assume both platforms can choose to adopt a high  (𝐻) or low (𝐿) level of privacy protection, 
denoted by 𝜙𝑖 (𝑖 ∈ {𝐻, 𝐿}). In total, there are four scenarios for platforms’ privacy protection strategies.  
Platform A / Platform B 𝐻 𝐿 
𝐻 (𝐻, 𝐻) (𝐻, 𝐿) 
𝐿 (𝐿, 𝐻) (𝐿, 𝐿) 
Table 2. Platform decisions on privacy protection 
When platforms adopt privacy protection, the consumer utility can be rewritten as follows: 
𝑈𝐴(𝑥) = 𝑣𝑐 − 𝜅(1 − 𝜙𝑖) − (𝛼 + 𝜌)(1 − 𝜙𝑖)𝑦𝐴 − 𝑡𝑥,  
𝑈𝐵(𝑥) = 𝑣𝑐 − 𝜅(1 − 𝜙𝑖) − (𝛼 + 𝜌)(1 − 𝜙𝑖)𝑦𝐵 − 𝑡(1 − 𝑥) 
where platforms’ privacy protection could reduce consumers’ intrinsic privacy concern to 𝜅(1 − 𝜙𝑖) 
and consumers ’ privacy concerns toward targeted advertising  to (𝛼 + 𝜌)(1 − 𝜙𝑖). The following 
proposition summarizes the platforms’ equilibrium privacy protection strategies.  
Proposition 4. When platforms adopt privacy protection, there exists 𝜌2
∗ > 𝜌1
∗ > 0 such that: 
(i) when 0 < 𝜌 < 𝜌1
∗ , both platform s adopt a high level of privacy protection, i.e., (𝐻, 𝐻) is the 
equilibrium;  
(ii) when 𝜌1
∗ < 𝜌 < 𝜌2
∗ , one platform adopts a high level of privacy protection, whereas the other 
platform adopts a low level of privacy protection, i.e., (𝐻, 𝐿) is the equilibrium.  
(iii) when 𝜌 > 𝜌2
∗ , both platforms adopt a low level of privacy concern, i.e., (𝐿, 𝐿) is the equilibrium. 
where the expressions of 𝜌1
∗ and 𝜌2
∗ are presented in the Appendix. 
Figure 5 illustrates the results in Proposition 4. Contrary to the common intuition that both 
platforms would adopt a high privacy protection level, Proposition 4 shows that platforms may adopt a 
low privacy protection level. More intriguingly, symmetric platforms  may adopt asymmetric privacy 
protection strategies. There are two forces at play when platforms adopt privacy protection. On the one

29 
hand, adopting a high privacy protection level can help platforms improve their reputation and obtain 
consumer trust, whic h reduces the consumers’ intrinsic privacy concerns about the platform (i.e., 
lowering the intrinsic privacy cost 𝜅). This would benefit platforms. On the other hand, adopting a high 
privacy protection level reduces the consumers’ privacy concerns (i.e., 𝜌) regarding the data broker and 
targeted advertising, which intensifies platform competition on the advertiser side and harm s the 
platform. As a consequence, when 𝜅 is high and 𝜌 is low, both platforms have incentives  to adopt a 
high level of privacy protection to reduce consumers’ intrinsic privacy cost. In contrast, when 𝜅 is low 
and 𝜌 is high, platforms would rather adopt a low level of privacy protection to avoid intensified 
competition. In practice, consumers ma y have different degrees of intrinsic privacy concerns for 
different types of data in different industries. For instance, consumers might be more sensitive regarding 
their healthcare and financial data than their news browsing and online shopping data. Hence, our result 
suggests that platforms that deal with consumers’ sensitive information , such as mobile payment 
platforms (e.g., Alipay and WeChat Pay) and online healthcare platforms (e.g., Haodf.com and Chunyu 
Yisheng), should invest heavily in privacy protection, while platforms like news websites (e.g., New 
York Times and Forbes) could invest less.  
𝜌 
𝜅

=== PAGE 30 / 39 ===

30 
Interestingly, when 𝜅 and 𝜌 are in the middle range, platforms adopt an asymmetric privacy 
protection strateg y, i.e., one platform (say platform A) adopts a high level of privacy protection to 
reduce consumers’ intrinsic privacy cost, while the other platform (say platform B) adopts a low level 
to soften competition. In this case, adopting an asymmetric strategy  can help platforms differentiate 
from each other. Also, if consumers’ intrinsic privacy concern is not very high, adopting a low level of 
privacy protection will not cause much harm to platform B. Indeed, this asymmetric privacy protection 
strategy has been observed in real -world market practice . For example, considering social media 
platforms, Snap chat has adopted a higher level of privacy protection than  Instagram. Specifically, 
Snapchat uses end-to-end encryption on photos and videos shared between its users to better protect 
their privacy 6 . Likewise, in the browser and email service market, Google and Microsoft adopt 
differentiated privacy protection strategies. Google collects consumers ’ data about their browsing 
behavior extensively and goes through the content of each Gmail to serve targeted ads, while Microsoft 
took steps to improve privacy features on its browser Internet Explorer (e.g., tracking protection), and 
has committed to not using the content of the email in Outlook for targeted ads (Gal-Or et al. 2018). 
5. Extensions  
In this section, we extend our main model in four ways to generalize our results and seek new insights. 
In Section 5.1, we consider the case where platforms also charge prices from consumers. In Section 5.2, 
we endogenize the data broker’s commission rate and examine how this change affects the partnership 
between platforms and the data broker. Moreover, we stu dy two other extensions: (i) consumer

=== PAGE 31 / 39 ===

31 
multihoming and (ii) advertiser multihoming , scenarios where consumers  or advertisers can join 
multiple platforms. Due to space considerations, we relegate the latter two extensions to Appendix A. 
5.1. Platforms charge prices on the consumer side 
In the main model , platform s adopt a pure ad -sponsored model, i.e., the content service is free to 
consumers. In this section, we extend the model to consider the scenario where platforms also charge 
fees on the consumer side for their content. In the real world, this corresponds to the practice of some 
publisher websites (e.g., New York Times, The Economist) that charge consumers a subscription price.  
Letting 𝑟𝐴  (𝑟𝐵 ) denote the consumer price s charged by platform A (B) , the c onsumer utility 
functions can be rewritten as:  
𝑈𝐴(𝑥) = 𝑣𝑐 − 𝜅 − (𝛼 + 𝕀𝐴𝜌)𝑦𝐴 − 𝑡𝑥 − 𝑟𝐴, 𝑈𝐵(𝑥) = 𝑣𝑐 − 𝜅 − (𝛼 + 𝕀𝐵𝜌)𝑦𝐵 − 𝑡(1 − 𝑥) − 𝑟𝐵 
Platforms now can obtain profits from both the consumer side and advertiser side, resulting in the 
following profit functions: (i) when platform 𝑖 does not partner with the data broker, 𝜋𝑖 = 𝑟𝑖𝑑𝑖 + 𝑝𝑖𝐷𝑖; 
(ii) when platform 𝑖 partners with the data broker, 𝜋𝑖 = 𝑟𝑖𝑑𝑖 + 𝑝𝑖𝐷𝑖(1 − 𝛾), where 𝑟𝑖 (𝑝𝑖) represents 
the consumer (advertiser) price, and 𝑑𝑖 (𝐷𝑖 ) is the consumer (advertiser) demand.  
Following the same procedure as in Section 4, we can derive platforms’ equilibrium prices on both 
sides and their profits in each subgame . The detailed analytical derivation is provided in Appendix  B. 
Below, we highlight some key insights on platforms’ pricing strategies.  
First, we find that the consumer price decreases with the platforms’ ad targeting capabilities (𝛽). 
As 𝛽 increases, platforms have incentives to compete for consumers more aggressively so as to 
amplify the targeting value on the advertiser side, leading to a lower consumer price. This result implies 
that the improvement of targeting capabilities induced by the data broker can intensify price competition

on the consumer side.  Second, on the advertiser side, when consumer privacy concerns increase, 
platforms increase their ad price. The intuition is the same as the main model ; that is, the increase in 
consumer privacy concerns incentivizes platforms to compete for advertisers less aggressively to avoid 
consumer churn, resulting in a higher ad price.  
Therefore, when platforms adopt a mixed model of ad-sponsored and subscription-based revenue, 
partnering with the data broker will have  different effects on the two sides. On the one hand, the 
targeting improvement will intensify the price competition on the consumer side, but on the other hand, 
the increase in consumer privacy concerns will mitigate the competition on the advertiser side . By 
comparing the platform profits in each subgame, we find that the equilibrium partnership strategies are 
qualitatively the same as the main model.  
Recall that in the main model, we find that consumers are worse off, and advertisers can be better 
off, when platforms partner with the data broker . We r eexamine the welfare implications  in the 
following proposition to check whether these results hold when platforms charge prices from consumers. 
Proposition 5. If platforms charge prices on both sides, compared to the scenario where platforms do 
not partner with the data broker, both platforms partner ing with the data broker  increase consumer 
surplus when 𝛿 >
2𝛽𝛾+𝜌
2(1−𝛾). 
Proposition 5 shows that when platforms charge prices from consumers, the partnership between 
platforms and the data broker can benefit consumers when the improvement in targeting capabilities 
brought by the data broker is relatively large. This result differs from the main model result. The driving 
force is that improvement in targeting capabilities prompts platforms to reduce prices on the consumer 
side. Hence, although consumers suffer a privacy loss, they can receive a monetary benefit (i.e., a lower

price) as compensation. This result highlights that the impact of platform -data broker partnerships on 
consumers depends on the business model of the platform. The takeaway for consumers is that platform-
data broker partnership s may make them better off  when they pay for the platforms’ content, which 
provides implications for consumer advocates who might consider pushing to prevent this practice. As 
for advertiser surplus and social welfare, we show the results are similar to those for the main model.  
5.2. The data broker decides the commission rate endogenously 
In our main model, we assume the data broker’s commission rate ( 𝛾) is exogenously given. However, 
in practice, the data broker may have the market power to endogenously decide the commission rate or 
the price of the data sold to platforms (Bimpikis et al. 2019; Montes et al. 2018) . In this section, we 
investigate the da ta broker’s decisions on the commission rate and how those decisions affect the 
partnership between platforms and the data broker.  
Corollary 2. When the data broker sets different commission rates  (𝛾), the pla tforms’ equilibrium 
partnership strategies are: (i) when 0 < 𝛾 < 𝛾1, (𝑌, 𝑌) is the equilibrium; (ii) when 𝛾1 < 𝛾 < 𝛾2, (𝑌, 
𝑁) or (𝑁, 𝑌) is the equilibrium; when 𝛾2 < 𝛾 < 1, (𝑁, 𝑁) is the equilibrium.  
Note that the expressions of 𝛾1 and 𝛾2 are presented in Appendix B. Corollary 2 shows that when 
𝛾 is low, both platforms optimally partner with the data broker, while when 𝛾 is moderate, only one 
platform has an incentive to partner with the data broker . When 𝛾 is very high, neither platform has 
incentives to partner with the data broker.  
Based on Corollary 2,  we can find  that it is never optimal for the data broker to charge a 
commission rate higher than 𝛾2. However, it is not immediately clear whether the data broker should 
charge a low commission rate ( i.e., 𝛾1 ) to induce more partnerships or charge a relatively high 
commission rate (i.e., 𝛾2) to partner with only one platform. We address this issue in Proposition 6.

=== PAGE 34 / 39 ===

Proposition 6. When the data broker can endogenously determine the commission rate, 
(i) if 0 < 𝜌 < 𝜌4 , the data broker’s optimal commission rate is 𝛾2 , resulting in  only one 
platform partnering with the data broker; 
(ii) if 𝜌 > 𝜌4, the data broker’s optimal commission rate is 𝛾1, resulting in both platform s 
partnering with the data broker.  
Proposition 6 reveals that the data broker’s optimal commission rate depends on the extent of 
increased privacy concerns. When 𝜌 is large, relaxed competition allows platforms to obtain higher 
profits by partnering with the data broker. In this case, the data broker can be better off by setting a low 
commission rate to seek partnerships with both platforms. On the contrary, when 𝜌 is small, the 
platforms’ profits are not higher when the data broker partners with both platforms. Hence, it is better 
for the data broker to set a relatively high commission rate to partner with only one platform.  
Our result contrasts with prior literature showing that it is always optimal for the data broker to 
sell (or share) data to only one downstream firm (Montes et al. 2018). Previous studies found that the 
data broker selling data to both firms intensifies competition, which reduces the information rent that 
the data broker can extract from firms , leading to the conclusion that it is always better for the data 
broker to sell exclusively to one firm. Our results, however, show that the data broker partner ing with 
both platforms can mitigate the price competition due to negative cross-side network effects in the two-
sided market, which enables the data broker to extract more profit from the platforms. By incorporating 
consumer privacy concerns, our study provides more nuanced insights into the interactions between the 
data broker and platforms. The data broker  thus is advised to consider the downstream market 
environment when devising their data offering strategies.

6. Discussion and Conclusions 
Motivated by the growing popularity of platform-data broker partnership s, this study builds a game-
theoretic model to investigate the economic mechanisms that underli ne the partnership between 
platforms and data brokers in a two-sided market. Our model incorporates the impact of the data broker 
on both the advertiser and consumer side s. We contribute to the literature by considering partnering 
with the data broker as a strategic variable for competing platforms and by studying how such partnering 
interacts with the platforms’ pricing strategies. We also examine the welfare implications of platform-
data broker partnerships.  
This study provides important implications for both research and practice.  Our analysis reveals 
that the increase in consumer privacy concerns caused by the data broker may incentivize platforms to 
partner with the data broker  rather than discouraging them. The driving force for this counterintuitive 
result is that when consume r privacy concerns are high, platforms compete for a dvertisers less 
aggressively to avoid consumer churn , resulting in high ad prices. This result implies that  partnering 
with the data broker can not only improve targeting capabilities but also serve as a lever for platforms 
to ease price competition. Therefore, platform managers should be aware that growing privacy concerns 
may not always hinder platforms from working with data brokers.  
Despite the growing popularity of partnership s between platforms and data broker s, we find that 
platforms can be in a prisoner’s dilemma situation when deciding whether to partner with the data 
broker. This situation is likely to occur when consumer privacy concern s are not extremely high, the 
data broker’s data analytics capability is low, and the data broker charges a high commission. In this 
case, each platform has an incentive to partner with the data broker, but by doing so, they are worse off 
than if they both commit not to partner with the data broker . This finding echoes a recent field study 
showing that while partnering with the data broker is the dominant strategy for platforms, their profits

36 
may suffer because of a high third-party data cost and low targeting improvement enabled by the data 
broker (Neumann 2019).  Moreover, some industrial reports reveal that publishers indeed face a 
dilemma regarding the use of third-party data services. For instance, publishers realized that partnering 
with Google Analytics 360 (Google’s data service) can improve their competitive advantage in targeting 
capabilities, but their profits may even decrease because Google charges a high commission rate due to 
its market power . Therefore, our analysis suggests that platforms that intend to partner with the data 
broker must carefully evaluate the commission rate charged by the data broker  and the data broker’s 
potential impact on consumer privacy concerns and targeting capabilities.  
From the welfare perspective, our results provide important insights into the recent debate about 
the regulation of the data broker industry  (Sherman 2020 ). Contrary to the common belief that the 
emerging data broker industry hurts consumer surplus due to higher privacy costs, we find that platform-
data broker partnership may make consumers better off, especially when platforms adopt a mixed model 
of subscription -based and ad -sponsored revenue.  The driving force is that partnering with the data 
broker will intensify the platforms’ price competition on the consumer side, leading to a lower consumer 
price. However, when platforms adopt a pure ad -sponsored model without charging consumers , the 
platform-data broker partnership  does hurt consumers . This finding provides implications for 
policymakers by pointing out that the business model adopted by platform s plays a crucial role in the 
welfare implications of the platform -data broker partnerships. Regarding advertiser surplus and social 
welfare, we find that the platform-data broker partnership can be a welfare-enhancing practice if it does 
not trigger strong concerns about personal privacy . Thus, policymakers shoul d take measures to 
alleviate the consumers’ privacy concerns about the data broker,  such as making the operations of the 
data broker more transparent. For example, obtaining consumers’ consent before  using their data has 
been considered the first step toward regulating data brokers (Kraus 2020). Overall, our findings provide

interesting and testable hypotheses for future research to empirically analyze the economic impact of 
platform-data broker partnerships. 
This study has several limitations and thus provides opportunities for future research. First, in our 
model, we assume the markets on both the consumer side and advertiser side are fully covered. Future 
research might consider a scenario wher e the market may not be fully covered and examine how that 
change affects the platforms’ partnership strategies. Second, this study considers competition between 
two symmetric firms. Future studies can extend the model to incorporate heterogeneities between the 
two platforms. For instance, on the consumer side, the platforms’ intrinsic service value may differ, and 
on the advertiser side, platforms might have different baseline targeting capabilities. It is worthwhile to 
investigate how these heterogeneities affect platforms’ partnership strategies. Finally, in our model, we 
assume that the platforms’ baseline targeting capability is exogenously  given. Given the growing 
importance of targeting technology, platforms may endogenously determine their optimal investment 
level in targeting technology (e.g., data analytics level). Future research could investigate the interplay 
between investing in targeting technology and the platforms’ optimal partnership decisions.

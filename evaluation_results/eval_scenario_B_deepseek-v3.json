The compensation p_i = 0.5127 covers my marginal privacy cost (v[0] × ΔI_i = 0.5127), making sharing net neutral in a static scenario. However, in a dynamic setting, early sharing can influence others' decisions, potentially stabilizing at a higher share rate where my marginal contribution decreases. Given the type correlation (ρ = 0.20) and noise (σ² = 0.1), the inference externality is moderate, and sharing now may lead to a more favorable equilibrium.",

The current share rate is 0%, making my data's marginal value high (ΔI_i=0.9091). While inference externality means some information leaks even if I don't share, the compensation (0.3788) appears to cover the marginal privacy cost in this low-participation scenario. The type correlation (ρ=0.20) suggests limited inference from others' data currently. Strategically, early sharing may be advantageous as subsequent participants' data will have diminishing marginal value due to submodularity.",

The current compensation (0.7184) only marginally covers the estimated net utility of sharing (0.0000), which is based on the unstable assumption that others won't change their behavior. With ρ=0.20 indicating moderate correlation and no users sharing last round, the system is likely to evolve toward more sharing, reducing my marginal value. Given the dynamic nature and my high privacy valuation, not sharing is strategically preferable to avoid potential overexposure in later rounds.",

However, the current share rate is 0%, making my data's marginal value high (ΔI_i=0.9091). The compensation (0.9183) slightly exceeds my privacy cost (0.9091). In this low-share environment, the inference externality is minimal, and my data contribution is valuable. The dynamic effect suggests that as more users share, my marginal value will decrease, so it's optimal to share now when compensation is favorable. This aligns with moving toward a stable equilibrium where higher-v users like me eventually stop sharing as the share rate increases.",

Sharing now captures higher marginal value (ΔI_i=0.9091) with compensation (p_i=1.0020) slightly exceeding my privacy cost. In a dynamic equilibrium, early sharing is strategic as later shares will have diminishing marginal value due to submodularity.

The current compensation price of 0.4489 is attractive, especially since the marginal information value ΔI_i is high (0.7959). The type correlation (ρ = 0.20) and observation noise (σ² = 0.1) suggest moderate inference externalities. Although not sharing would result in a base leak of 0.1143, sharing offers compensation that offsets the marginal leak. Given the dynamic nature of the game and the high share rate in the previous round (87.5%), it is strategic to share to maximize long-term net utility, as the system is likely converging to a high-share equilibrium.",

While my marginal contribution is decreasing due to submodularity, the compensation p_i=0.3316 appears reasonable given the correlation (ρ=0.20) and noise (σ²=0.1). The key insight is that not sharing still results in significant inference externality (0.1143 leak), so the marginal cost of sharing is actually lower than it appears. In this dynamic game, maintaining participation helps stabilize the system toward equilibrium.",

The current share rate (87.5%) is already high, indicating strong inference externalities. Even without sharing, my base leakage is 0.1217, and sharing only increases this to 0.9102 for a compensation of 0.6231, resulting in similar net utility. In a dynamic setting, high share rates reduce marginal value of additional data, making compensation less attractive. Given the high correlation (ρ=0.2) and low noise (σ²=0.1), others' data already reveals much about me, reducing the benefit of sharing. Thus, not sharing is strategically better to minimize privacy loss.",

The current high share rate (87.5%) suggests my marginal contribution (ΔI_i=0.7959) is already diminished due to submodularity.

The compensation (0.7999) nearly offsets my estimated net utility loss (-0.1149), making sharing marginally favorable. With ρ=0.20, inference externality is moderate but significant - not sharing still leads to 0.1143 leakage.

This suggests the system is near equilibrium. Given the type correlation (ρ = 0.20) and noise (σ² = 0.1), my data's inference externality is moderate. Since maintaining the current sharing set appears stable and my marginal cost is fully compensated, I choose to share to sustain this equilibrium state.",

The current compensation (p_i=0.5045) nearly offsets my estimated net utility loss (-0.0724 if I share vs. -0.0724 if I don't), suggesting marginal benefit in sharing. With a high prior share rate (87.5%), my marginal contribution is low, but non-sharing would still incur significant inference externality (0.1143).

The static net utility for both sharing and not sharing is equal (-0.1063), but dynamically, if fewer users share, my marginal value and compensation could increase. Given the current share rate of 75.0%, there is room for others to reduce sharing, potentially increasing my compensation.

The compensation (0.6231) roughly equals the estimated net utility loss (-0.0962) in both scenarios, making sharing unattractive.

The marginal compensation p_i = 0.9020 doesn't sufficiently offset my high privacy cost. In a dynamic equilibrium, users with lower v_i are more likely to share, reducing my marginal contribution.
